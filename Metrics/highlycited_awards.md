| Metric Definition             | "The position of a paper or group of papers with respect to other papers in a given discipline, country, and/or time period, based on the number of citations they have received. Expressed as a percentile or awarded a [“Highly Cited” honorific](http://ipscience-help.thomsonreuters.com/inCites2Live/indicatorsGroup/aboutHandbook/usingCitationIndicatorsWisely/highlyCitedPapers.html) based upon percentile rankings.
| Metric Calculation            | [Citation percentiles](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22775) are defined as “[a] percentile-based bibliometric indicator is an indicator that values publications based on their position within the citation distribution of their field. The most straightforward percentile-based indicator is the proportion of frequently cited publications, for instance the proportion of publications that belong to the top 10% most frequently cited of their field.”
|| Note that depending upon the data source, percentiles can be expressed differently, in that an “inverted percentile” (e.g. 1%) and regular percentile (e.g. 99th percentile) are interpreted to mean the same thing.
|| Clarivate Analytics’s [InCites platform has been credited](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2012.10.001) for classifying percentiles in a particularly clear and specific manner (i.e. by showing not only the top 1% of papers, but also those in the top 0.1% and 0.01%), giving “a better indication of skew and ranking among the top-cited publications”.
|| SciVal [provides a slightly different reference set than other providers](https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/resource-library/scival-metrics-guidebook): percentiles for each year are calculated against the entire Scopus database by default, and different comparison axes (called “data universes”), such as publication type, can be used for further comparison. [In SciVal](https://libguides.usc.edu.au/c.php?g=508927&p=3480476), “Outputs in Top Percentiles can only be calculated for the current year from the first data snapshot on or after 1 July. It will be displayed as a null value until this date is reached”.
| Data Sources | Counts and percentiles are calculated using citation data from Web of Science or Scopus.
| Appropriate Use Cases | [Percentiles based jointly upon subject area, document type (i.e. research or review articles), and year of publication](http://doi.org/10.1038/embor.2013.9) are described as being the most appropriate means of comparison between journal articles or groups of journal articles. Essentially they follow the same logic as any other field-normalized citation indicator, with the advantage that [percentile-based citation indicators are less prone to be influenced by outliers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09985).
| Limitations | Percentile-based indicators are based on citations, so they inherit [all of citations’ limitations](http://www.metrics-toolkit.org/citations-articles/), including that a number of factors that can influence the citation rates for publications within subject areas and year of publication, including [gender](http://www.doi.org/10.1038/504211a), the [number of co-authors](http://www.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2505), the [nationalities of authors](https://doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000007153), and outliers (very high or low cited publications). As such, these percentiles should be interpreted with care.
|| Though in theory simple to calculate, there are a number of possible variations in formulae used to calculate percentiles; as such, [percentiles are only directly comparable when the same calculation is used for each](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2012.10.001).
|| Field-normalization has its own inherent limitations that impact the use of percentiles. The accuracy of field classification will affect the usefulness of a field’s percentiles, as will cases where a single paper may be assigned to several different fields (each of which can have highly variable median citation counts).
| Inappropriate Use Cases | In general, percentiles based upon very small comparison sets are ill-advised, as just one or two additional publication may substantially increase or decrease the share of highly cited publications.
|| Percentiles should not be used to make judgements about papers using reference sets that compare papers with other papers [published in the same journal](https://doi.org/10.1038/embor.2013.9). Comparisons of groups of papers (e.g. for an individual’s body of work) should only be made given a [sufficiently large corpus, as in the case of senior researchers](http://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22792). When evaluating heterogenous or interdisciplinary groups of papers, it’s possible that important subtopics with low citation densities may be left out.
