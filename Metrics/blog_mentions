| Name | Blog Mentions
| Can Apply To | Primarily articles, books, and other scholarly items with [persistent identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier), such as a DOI, url, or handle
| Metric Definition | The number of times a scholarly output has been linked to from a blog.
| Metric Calculation | Blog mentions are comprised of raw counts of links to outputs, from blogs. Some services track links only for items with a persistent identifier.
| Data Sources | Links from both scholarly and general interest blogs are tracked, though coverage varies between altmetrics services.
| Appropriate Use Cases | Discussions on blogs have been found to have a [slight correlation to later citations](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064841). They are not a sure-fire indicator for later citations. Use blog mentions only to learn what other researchers or members of the public are saying about a piece of research. The number of blog mentions is less important than what is being said.
| Limitations | Given their unvetted nature, it is risky to assume that a link to a piece of research from any blog–even a scholarly one–constitutes quality criticism.
| Inappropriate Use Cases | Blog mentions should not be interpreted as a direct measure of quality or impact, even amongst researcher blog networks.
| Available Metric Sources | [Altmetric](http://altmetric.com/), [PlumX](http://plumanalytics.com/), [Impactstory](http://impactstory.org/), [CrossRef Event Data](https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/)(for items with DOIs, on Wordpress.com-hosted blogs)
| Transparency | In all altmetrics services in which blog mentions are available, one can access the full-text of the blog mentions, making this a relatively transparent metric. However, no altmetrics service makes their full list of blogs tracked available, making it difficult to know the scope of such blogs overall.
| Website | n/a
| Timeframe | Altmetric began tracking blog mentions in October 2011 (meaning Impactstory’s coverage spans this time frame, as well). PlumX does not share information on its coverage dates for blog mentions.
