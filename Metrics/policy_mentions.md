| Name | Primarily research outputs such as journal articles and books
| Can Apply To | The number of times a research output has been cited in policy documents from government bodies or NGOs.
| Metric Definition | Narrative definition of what the metric calculates
| Metric Calculation | The total count of citations to a research output in the policy sources being tracked by the metric provider. Each provider tracks differing manually-curated lists of policy bodies.
| Data Sources | Governmental and non-governmental policy documents
| Appropriate Use Cases | Policy mentions can be used to demonstrate how research has influenced policy or the course of action in a particular field.
| Limitations | Research and researchers may influence policy and decision making in indirect ways that are not always trackable via policy citations ([Konkiel, 2016](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/02/02/tracking-the-path-from-research-to-public-policy-on-the-social-web/)). One study found that “less than 0.5% of the papers published in different subject categories are mentioned at least once in policy-related documents” ([Haunschild, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01822)). In Altmetric, only those books, book chapters, and journal articles with DOIs can be tracked in policy. It is unknown if PlumX has similar restrictions.
| Inappropriate Use Cases | Policy mentions should not be used as a direct measure of a research output’s effect on practice.
| Available Metric Sources | [Altmetric](http://altmetric.com/), [PlumX](http://plumanalytics.com/)
| Transparency | In relevant providers, one can access the full-text of the policy mentions. However, all providers keep their full list of tracked policy sources private.
| Website | n/a
| Timeframe | Altmetric has been [tracking policy mentions since 2013](https://help.altmetric.com/support/solutions/articles/6000136884-when-did-altmetric-start-tracking-attention-to-each-attention-source-). Plum Analytics reportedly began tracking policy mentions in 2016, though no publicly available documentation can confirm this.
