| Name | "Highly Cited Papers" and "% Highly Cited Papers" awards
| Can Apply To | Journal articles
| Metric Definition | "Highly Cited Papers" is an indicator that reveals how many times an article has been cited, compared to other articles in a discipline, journal, or country, or published in the same time period. As Clarivate Analytics [describes the designation](http://ipscience-help.thomsonreuters.com/inCites2Live/indicatorsGroup/aboutHandbook/usingCitationIndicatorsWisely/highlyCitedPapers.html), "Highly Cited Papers are considered to be indicators of scientific excellence and top performance and can be used to benchmark research performance against field baselines worldwide." Highly Cited Papers are expressed as the volume of articles that have received the top one percent of citations in each of the 22 Essential Science Indicators (ESI) subject areas per year. 
| Metric Calculation | The basic methods for calculating percentiles in various providers, upon which "Highly Cited" designations are based, can be found on the [Citation Percentiles, Articles](http://www.metrics-toolkit.org/citations-percentiles-articles/) Metrics Toolkit page. 

[% Highly Cited Papers](http://ipscience-help.thomsonreuters.com/inCites2Live/indicatorsGroup/aboutHandbook/usingCitationIndicatorsWisely/HighlyCitedPapers.html) (InCites) "shows the number of ESI Highly Cited Papers for an entity (paper, author, institution, country, journal and field) divided by the total number of documents produced by the given entity, represented as a percentage."

Outputs in Top Percentiles (Scival)
| Data Sources | Counts and percentiles are calculated using citation data from Web of Science, Scopus, or Dimensions
| Appropriate Use Cases | [Bornmann & Marx (2013)](http://doi.org/10.1038/embor.2013.9) describe percentiles based jointly upon subject area, document type, and year of publication as being the most appropriate means of comparison between journal articles or groups of journal articles.
| Limitations | There are a number of factors that can influence the citation rates for publications within subject areas and year of publication, including the gender of the lead author, the number of co-author, and the nationalities of authors. As such, percentiles should be interpreted with care.

Though in theory simple to calculate, there are a number of possible variations in formulae used to calculate percentiles; as such, percentiles are only directly comparable when it is assured that the same calculation is used for each [(Bornmann, Leydesdorff & Mutz, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2012.10.001). Moreover, for articles that are assigned several subject areas (each of which can have highly variable median citation counts) percentile ranks must be interpreted with care.

In SciVal, "Outputs in Top Percentiles can only be calculated for the current year from the first data snapshot on or after 1 July. It will be displayed as a null value until this date is reached" [(USC Australia, 2017)](https://libguides.usc.edu.au/c.php?g=508927&p=3480476).

| Inappropriate Use Cases | Percentiles should not be used to make judgements about papers using reference sets based upon journals [(Bornmann & Marx, 2012)](https://doi.org/10.1038/embor.2013.9). Comparisons of groups of papers (e.g. for an individual's body of work) should only be made given a sufficiently large corpus, as in the case of senior researchers [Bornmann, 2013](http://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22792).

| Transparency | The specific formulae and source citation data used to calculate percentiles can vary between providers and are not always publicly documented. Use with caution.
