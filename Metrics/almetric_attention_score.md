| Name | Altmetric Attention Score
| Can Apply To | Journal articles, books, and any research output deposited to a repository that the company tracks (e.g. Figshare, Zenodo, or an institutional repository)|
| Metric Definition | "The Altmetric Attention Score is an automatically calculated, weighted count of all of the attention a research output has received [online, in sources tracked by Altmetric]."|
| Metric Calculation | The AAS takes into account the volume of attention received by a research output across a number of online attention sources (e.g. Twitter, Pubpeer, etc). Each source is [weighted by the company](https://help.altmetric.com/support/solutions/articles/6000060969-how-is-the-altmetric-attention-score-calculated-). The AAS weighting also takes into account whether the author of a mention of a research output regularly posts about research.
| Data Sources | News articles, Blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Sina Weibo, Wikipedia, Policy Documents (per source), Q&A, F1000, Publons, Pubpeer, YouTube, Reddit, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Open Syllabus, Google+
| Limitations | The AAS does not take into account the sentiments of mentions made about research objects, and thus does not help one understand the positive nor negative attention that a piece of research has received. According to [Lockwood (2016)](http://doi.org/10.15200/winn.146723.36330), "Article titles with result-oriented positive framing and more interesting phrasing receive higher Altmetric [attention] scores". Conflicting research exists as to whether the number of collaborators on a paper may increase or decrease an AAS ([Didegah, 2016](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/89331); [Haustein, Costas & Larivière, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120495)). International collaborations may increase an AAS [(Didegah, 2016)](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/89331). Institutional prestige of authors reportedly does not affect an AAS [(Didegah, 2016)](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/89331). Legitimate self-promotion by authors may artificially increase an AAS [(Adie, 2013)](https://www.altmetric.com/blog/gaming-altmetrics/). Journal impact factor and article accessibility may positively influence an article's AAS; "publications from Social Sciences & Humanities have more mentions on Twitter and Facebook...[thus impacting an article's AAS] than publications from both Engineering & Technology and Medical & Natural sciences" [(Didegah, 2016)](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/89331).
| Inappropriate Use Cases | The AAS should not be used as a direct measure of research impact of any kind, or quality.
| Available Metric Sources | The AAS can be found in all products offered by [Altmetric](http://www.altmetric.com/), including the free researcher bookmarklet and on many journal publisher websites. The [Dimensions](https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication) database also includes the Altmetric Attention Score for the articles it indexes.
| Transparency | To date, it is not possible to fully audit the AAS, as the weighting of the score depends upon non-public, company-assigned "tiers" for news sources, Twitter users, and some other sources that mention a research output.
