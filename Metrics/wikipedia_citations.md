| Name | Wikipedia Citations
| Can Apply To | Primarily scholarly publications with a persistent identifier, such as a DOI
| Metric Definition | References to scholarly outputs in Wikipedia articles, which are linked to in order to support the the entry’s claims.
| Metric Calculation | The number of times a scholarly output has been referenced in Wikipedia articles.  The specific tracking method is dependent on the metric source provider.  [Altmetric tracks and calculates Wikipedia citations via identifiers and titles that appear in a valid Wikipedia citation](https://help.altmetric.com/support/solutions/articles/6000060980-how-does-altmetric-track-mentions-on-wikipedia), whereas [PlumX mines the full text entry for DOIs, PMIDs, and URLs](http://plumanalytics.com/wikipedia-altmetrics-calculating-mention-metrics/).
| Data Sources | The exact tracking method and coverage of various Wikipedia languages varies.
| Appropriate Use Cases | Depending on the context of the citation, Wikipedia references can be interpreted to indicate several kinds of impact, such as a work’s defining influence on a field.  To this end, how and where an item is referenced is more important than the count of Wikipedia cations.
| Limitations | While Wikipedia has guidelines for using and referencing reliable published sources and content criteria, anyone can contribute to the online encyclopedia.  [Additionally, Wikipedia’s coverage of the published literature is relatively narrow and more evidence about the relationship between Wikipedia citations and other metrics, such article citations counts, is needed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4745).  [A recent study did find that Open Access and high impact journals were more likely to be on English Wikipedia](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23687/full).
| Inappropriate Use Cases | Raw Wikipedia citation counts should not be interpreted as a direct measure of quality or impact. The full context of Wikipedia citations must be investigated to understand the kinds of impact the references reflect.

| Transparency | In all of the altmetric services in which Wikipedia citations are available, one can access the full-text of the citing Wikipedia pages.
| Website | [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/)
| Timeframe | Wikipedia was launched in 2001, but scholarly items can be cited regardless of age.
