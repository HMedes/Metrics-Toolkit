| Name | Pubpeer Comments
| Can Apply To |  Research papers with a [persistent identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_identifier) (e.g., digital object identifier (DOI), PubMed ID, or ArXiv ID)
| Metric Definition | Pubpeer is a post-publication peer review platform.  The full text of comments submitted by registered and unregistered users are publicly available.
| Metric Calculation | Pubpeer comments can be generated by registered and unregistered users for any paper with a DOI, PubMed ID, or ArXiv ID. Full text comments can be retrieved via persistent identifier, keywords, and author names. Comments by registered users are immediately published, while comments by unregistered users are screened for spam content.
| Data Sources | Comments on articles generated by registered and unregistered Pubpeer users
| Appropriate Use Cases | Pubpeer comments can be used to provide preliminary insight into how a paper is being received and discussed within a research community.
| Limitations | While comments can be generated for any paper with a persistent identifier (i.e. DOI, PMID, or ArXiv ID), coverage is limited to and driven by user activity, and not the quality or significance of individual papers.  Therefore, differences in quality or significance should not be inferred when comparing papers with and without Pubpeer comments.
| Inappropriate Use Cases | Pubpeer comments are not a replacement for traditional peer review, and should not be used as a measure of research impact.

| Transparency | Pubpeer comments are published for registered and unregistered users.  Unregistered users are always anonymous.  Only the user name, not the specific identity or credentials, of registered users is available.

| Timeframe | Pubpeer comments have been available since 2012, but comments can be generated for any paper with a DOI, PubMed ID, or ArXiv ID.
