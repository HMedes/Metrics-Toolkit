| Name | Amazon: Ratings and Reviews
| Can Apply To | Books
| Metric Definition | Amazon.com ratings are submitted by end users and allotted on a one- to five-point scale. Amazon.com reviews are text commentary submitted by readers. Both apply to individual books.
| Metric Calculation | Ratings and reviews are retrieved by altmetrics services based upon a book’s ISBN. Overall book ratings are calculated as a type of weighted average according to a “machine learning algorithm”, about which few details are known. User verification seems to play a part in the weighting for both reviews and ratings, meaning in theory these data are more difficult to game. Other users can upvote Amazon.com reviews as “helpful”, which [impacts the visibility of said review and therefore the influence that the review has upon prospective readers.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=918083)
| Data Sources | User-submitted Amazon.com ratings and reviews
| Appropriate Use Cases | Review content, especially from notable reviewers (e.g., a positive review from a Nobel laureate), can be used to demonstrate the popular reception of a book. “Number of reviews” [has been recommended](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23404/full) as a means to understand the wider popularity of a book. According to [Thelwall & Kousha (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23404/full), “Amazon book reviews presumably reflect to some extent the teaching impact … or cultural benefit of books …, rather than their impact on future research.”
| Limitations | It is possible for those who do not own an item to submit both Amazon.com reviews and ratings (cf. the phenomenon of the [Three Wolf Moon t-shirt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Wolf_Moon)).
| Inappropriate Use Cases | Ratings should not be used as a direct measure of quality or influence. Users might leave poor reviews for a variety of reasons, including delayed shipping or a [philosophical disagreement](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/a-casualty-on-the-battlefield-of-amazons-partisan-book-reviews.html) with the central thesis of a work.
| Available Metric Sources | [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), [PlumX](http://plumanalytics.com/)
| Transparency | Data on Amazon.com is fully auditable, in that it is possible to read all reviews and ratings for an item. However, it is possible for reviewers to rate and review a title using a pseudonym, so these data are not completely protected from falsification.

| Timeframe | Reviews have been available since at least 2010. Ratings have been tested periodically since approximately 2014. Both are available for books of any age.
