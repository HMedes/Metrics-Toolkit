<h2>Metrics Toolkit Editorial Board</h2>
<p>The Metrics Toolkit Editorial Board is comprised of scientometrics experts well-versed in research impact metrics and their real-world applications.  Editors make a one-year commitment to maintain and develop new Toolkit content by staying abreast of the relevant literature and joining monthly Editorial Board calls.  In collaboration with the Toolkit's co-founders, Editorial Board members work to ensure the Metrics Toolkit provides current and evidence driven information about research metrics.</p>
