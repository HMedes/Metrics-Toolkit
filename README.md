## The Metrics Toolkit

The [Metrics Toolkit](http://www.metrics-toolkit.org/) provides evidence-based information about research metrics across disciplines, including how each metric is calculated, where you can find it, and how each should (and should not) be applied.  It also includes examples of how to use metrics in grant applications, CVs, and promotion dossiers.

There are two ways to use the Toolkit. [Explore metrics](http://www.metrics-toolkit.org/explore-metrics/) to browse the metrics you want to learn more about. Or, you can [choose metrics](http://www.metrics-toolkit.org/choose-metrics/) that will be best for your use case by filtering via our broad discipline, research output, and impact type categories. 

The Metrics Toolkit was developed thanks to the 2016 Force11 PitchIt! Innovation grant, as well as support from Oregon Health & Science University, IUPUI, and Altmetric.

**Documentation**

We developed a [schema](http://www.metrics-toolkit.org/about/metric-description-schema/) to consistently describe all of the metrics documented in the Metrics Toolkit.  The schema and metrics files are stored in the [Metrics folder](https://github.com/Metrics-Toolkit/Metrics-Toolkit/tree/master/Metrics) of this repository.
